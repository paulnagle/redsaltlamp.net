# Thoughts
A blog could be a good way to organise thoughts. It coud also be a good way to become familiar with markdown, even though most markdown is pretty trivial.

## Why organise thoughts
It's good to be clear about things. It's important to be able to use language to express this clarity.

### What things should I be clear about
I'm not really sure how to organise all of this. What are the life things that I need to be really clear about. My relationships? My morals/ethics? My red lines? Things that I do not want myself to do, and things that I do not want others to do to me. There are things that I care that other people don't do to other people as well, even though I consider myself to be very liberal about most things.

### Hard mode vs. easy mode
Where was that good blog that I read about the guy who talks about playing in hard mode and in easy mode
